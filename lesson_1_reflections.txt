How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
By looking at the history

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
No worries about keeping track

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
manual: commit make more sense
automatic: can not forget, keep history anyway

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because in coding multiple files are related

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log: gives me the history
git diff: detail of each change

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I check anytime revet back

git diff
git clone
git checkout
git log
git status
